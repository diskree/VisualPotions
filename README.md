Unique textures for potions that look the same in Vanilla! Now you can identify potions without needing to hover over them.

### Long/strong effects

I made a <font color='yellow'>yellow</font> cap for potions enhanced with <font color='yellow'>glowstone</font> and <font color='red'>red</font> cap for potions enhanced with <font color='red'>redstone</font>. 

### Tipped Arrows

Color of the potion cap will be used to color the base of the arrow.

### Thick Potion
